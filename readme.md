### Preface

> As an avid Chess enjoyer, I play on Chess.com and Lichess quite often. Occasionally, when I am bored I like to play the various variants of Chess on these platforms. Playing these variants is often reserved as a casual time waster. But the idea of playing them competitively has crossed my mind several times. This project aims to scratch that itch, and build a competitive community around each unique variant. As an engineering problem, its scope is wide and vast and seemingly endless. Live and dynamic interfaces, modular and expansive game logic, custom machine learning algorithms and not to mention all the common social media esque features you would need to keep visitors coming back. Sitting here, I can spend hours coming up with new features to add. I see it as an ultimate pet projectâ€” one not built for profit but one built to enjoy the self expression of writing code as if it were my hobby and not my job.
